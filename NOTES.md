## INVENTORY

Goal:

- Items in pack take time to grab so it behooves you to put things in your belt you need in a pinch (weapons, potions, scrolls) and things that you can take your time to retrieve in the backpack.

MVP:

- Backpack to hold inventory
- Ability to select items
- Drop
- wield/wear/quaff/eat/etc
- show description

V2:

- Move items from backpack to belt
- Weight on all items
- Ability to throw backpack
- Removing backpack should reduce encumberance in battle
- Using items in pack requires in game time where the game ticks on for as long as is required
- Getting items from backpack requires in game time where the game ticks on - can be interrupted. So not useful to try and grab something during a fight - should look instead to your belt
- Money has weight
- Will need to find a way to get vast sums of gold back to civilization where you can actually make use of it...
